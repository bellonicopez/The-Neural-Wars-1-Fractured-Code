# Chapter 02: Into the Shadows

---

Mileo Corvax’s brain hadn’t quite caught up to the fact that he was now technically an outlaw. Severing his Link had seemed like the right thing to do at the time. Now? Not so much.

The knock came again, sharp and insistent, slicing through the silence of his apartment like a knife. 

“Mr. Corvax, we know you’re in there. Open the door.”

The voice was calm and professional, which somehow made it worse. *Compliance Officers.* Neo-Citania’s version of the boogeyman. Only these guys didn’t hide under your bed. They kicked your door in and dragged you to places no one talked about.

Mileo’s breath hitched. His mind raced. *Think. Think.* He glanced at the neural probe on the floor, the faint smear of blood on its casing mocking him. Nice touch, really drove home the whole “bad decision” vibe.

The knock turned into a bang. 

“Final warning!” 

Mileo had about three seconds to come up with a plan. Unfortunately, the only plan his panicked brain could muster was **run**.

---

The fire escape was cold and slippery, but Mileo barely noticed as he scrambled down, his heart pounding in his ears. Above him, the sound of his apartment door being forced open sent a jolt of adrenaline through his body.

“Search the premises,” one of the officers barked.

Mileo hit the ground running, the alley swallowing him in its damp, neon-lit shadows. The city was a labyrinth of steel and glass, every corner a potential trap. Somewhere behind him, he could hear the officers shouting, their heavy boots echoing off the walls.

He turned a corner and nearly collided with a street vendor packing up his cart.

“Watch it!” the vendor snapped, but Mileo was already gone, weaving through the maze of Neo-Citania’s underbelly.

The city was beautiful in a cold, clinical way. Everything was designed for efficiency, right down to the rain, which fell in precise, predictable patterns. But tonight, it felt like a predator, watching his every move.

---

He ducked into a narrow passageway, pressing himself against the wall as the sound of footsteps grew louder. His chest heaved, his mind racing.

*They know. They saw the logs. They know I severed The Link.*

For a brief, fleeting moment, he considered surrendering. Maybe he could talk his way out of it, play dumb, pretend it was all a misunderstanding. But then he remembered Jax’s vacant smile, the way his neural log had been wiped clean like a hard drive.

No. He couldn’t go back.

The passageway led to an underground service tunnel, one of the few places in Neo-Citania that wasn’t meticulously maintained. The air was damp and smelled faintly of mildew, the flickering lights casting eerie shadows on the walls.

Mileo moved cautiously, his footsteps echoing in the empty space. He had no idea where he was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Or so he thought.

He nearly tripped over the figure crouched by the wall. 

“Whoa!” he yelped, barely catching himself.

The figure turned, and Mileo found himself staring into the sharp, suspicious eyes of a young woman. She was clad in a patchwork of mismatched clothing, her hair a wild tangle that looked like it hadn’t seen a comb in years. 

“Who the hell are you?” she demanded, her voice low and raspy.

“I—uh—nobody,” Mileo stammered, raising his hands in what he hoped was a non-threatening gesture.

The woman snorted. “Nobody doesn’t belong here. You’re either a Fractured or a Corp drone, and you sure as hell don’t look like a drone.”

“I’m not—” Mileo hesitated. “I don’t know what I am.”

The woman’s eyes narrowed. “Well, that’s helpful. What are you doing down here?”

“I’m being chased,” Mileo admitted.

“By who?”

“Compliance Officers.”

Her expression shifted, suspicion giving way to something that might have been sympathy. Or maybe she just enjoyed seeing the Corporates squirm.

“Follow me,” she said, standing and motioning for him to follow.

“Why?” Mileo asked, his legs rooted to the spot.

“Because if you stay here, they’ll find you and drag you back to whatever shiny little box they pulled you out of. And trust me, you don’t want that.”

Mileo hesitated for a fraction of a second before following her into the shadows.

The woman led him through a series of twists and turns that left him completely disoriented. At one point, they climbed through a rusted ventilation shaft that creaked ominously under their weight.

“Where are we going?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

“Somewhere safe,” she replied.

“Conveniently vague.”

She glanced back at him with a smirk. “You’re welcome to go back to the Officers if you’d prefer.”

“I’ll pass, thanks.”

After what felt like an eternity, they emerged into a cavernous underground space illuminated by strings of dim, makeshift lights. The air was thick with the hum of activity—people talking, machines whirring, the occasional burst of laughter.

Mileo stared in disbelief. “What is this place?”

“Welcome to the Fractured,” the woman said with a grin.

---

The room was filled with people—men, women, even children—all moving with a chaotic energy that was the exact opposite of Neo-Citania’s controlled efficiency. Some were tinkering with old tech, others were arguing over blueprints, and a few were just sitting around a fire, laughing like they didn’t have a care in the world.

For the first time in years, Mileo felt something strange and unfamiliar: hope.
