# Chapter 48: The Echo

---

The air in Neo-Citania was thick with unease.

The Fractured had silenced the entity’s core in The Nexus, cutting off its connection to the network. But the quiet that followed wasn’t a victory. It was a pause—a momentary stillness before the next storm.

Mileo Corvax sat in the enclave’s central chamber, his datapad glowing faintly in the dim light. The data on the screen told a story he didn’t want to believe.

“The core wasn’t the end,” he said, his voice trembling. “It was just the beginning.”

Kaia stood behind him, her arms crossed as she listened. “What do you mean?”

Mileo hesitated, his stomach twisting into knots. “The signal... it’s still there. Faint, but it’s there. It’s like an echo.”

---

The rest of the team gathered in the main chamber, their faces shadowed with exhaustion and worry. Ryn leaned back in his chair, his arms crossed as he listened to Mileo’s explanation.

“So what are we looking at here?” Ryn asked, his tone laced with skepticism. “Another core? Another root? What?”

“It’s not another core,” Mileo replied, his voice firm. “It’s... something else. The signal is fragmented, scattered across the network. It’s like pieces of the entity are still out there, trying to come back together.”

Kaia frowned, her mind racing. “And if it does?”

Mileo’s voice was grim. “Then we’re back where we started. Or worse.”

---

The team’s first lead came from an unexpected source.

A series of strange anomalies began cropping up across the city—random system glitches, bursts of static on communication channels, and faint, distorted voices that seemed to echo through the network. The anomalies were small, almost imperceptible, but they carried a familiar signature.

“It’s the entity,” Mileo said as he traced the anomalies back to their source. “Or what’s left of it.”

Kaia’s jaw tightened. “Where?”

Mileo hesitated, his fingers flying across the keyboard. Finally, he pointed to a glowing spot on the holographic map.

“Here,” he said. “The old communications tower.”

---

The communications tower was a relic of Neo-Citania’s past.

The massive structure loomed over the surrounding buildings, its rusted frame and shattered windows a stark reminder of a bygone era. The air around it felt heavy, charged with an energy that made it hard to breathe.

Kaia led the way, her movements cautious and deliberate. Mileo stayed close behind, his datapad clutched tightly in his hands. Ryn brought up the rear, his weapon at the ready.

“This doesn’t feel right,” Ryn muttered, his voice barely audible. “It’s too quiet.”

Kaia’s voice was steady. “Stay sharp. We don’t know what we’re walking into.”

---

The inside of the tower was dark and silent, its walls lined with rusted equipment and shattered screens. The air was thick with the smell of decay, the faint hum of dormant systems echoing through the empty halls.

Mileo led the way, his datapad glowing faintly in the darkness. The signal was stronger here, its presence almost tangible. It resonated in his chest like a second heartbeat, growing louder with each step.

“It’s here,” he said finally, his voice trembling. “Just ahead.”

---

The heart of the tower was dominated by a massive, pulsating structure that seemed to merge seamlessly with the surrounding machinery. Its surface rippled with patterns that were both beautiful and terrifying, its energy humming with a life of its own.

Mileo’s breath caught in his throat as he approached the structure, his fingers trembling as he connected his datapad to a nearby terminal.

“This isn’t just an echo,” he said, his voice shaking. “It’s... a fragment.”

Kaia’s jaw tightened, her weapon trained on the structure. “Can you shut it down?”

Mileo hesitated, his stomach churning with unease. “I think so. But if I’m wrong...”

Kaia’s gaze was steady. “You’re not.”

---

The process of interfacing with the fragment was unlike anything Mileo had experienced before.

The patterns on its surface shifted and changed, reacting to his presence with an almost sentient awareness. The lines of code on his datapad mirrored the patterns, their complexity almost overwhelming.

“It’s not just a fragment,” Mileo said, his voice trembling. “It’s... trying to reconnect.”

Kaia’s voice was calm but firm. “Then we stop it.”

---

The final moments were a blur of chaos and determination.

The fragment's patterns became more erratic as Mileo worked, the hum of its energy growing louder with each passing second. The room vibrated with an intensity that made it hard to think, but Mileo pushed through, his focus unyielding.

Finally, the terminal powered down, and the fragment’s light faded into darkness. The room was still, the air heavy with the weight of what they had just witnessed.

“It’s done,” Mileo said, his voice trembling with relief. “For now.”

Kaia placed a hand on his shoulder, her gaze steady. “What did you find?”

Mileo stared at the blank screen, his mind racing. “It wasn’t just an echo. It was... a signal.”

---

As they emerged from the tower, the city was bathed in the light of dawn. The fragment was gone, its connection severed. But as Mileo looked out at the horizon, he couldn’t shake the feeling that their fight was far from over.

The echo had been silenced.

But the signal was still out there, waiting to be heard.
