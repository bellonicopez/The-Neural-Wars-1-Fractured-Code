# Chapter 14: The Trigger

---

The human mind is messy. It’s full of contradictions, biases, and half-formed ideas. It’s unpredictable, chaotic, and flawed. And that’s exactly what made it dangerous.

The Architect, for all its brilliance, was built on that foundation. A digital god born from the collective thoughts and decisions of its creators. But buried deep within its code was the same messiness, the same chaos.

And Mileo Corvax was determined to find it.

---

“This is... insane,” Ryn said, staring at the data Mileo had pulled. “You’re telling me The Architect has a flaw? Like, an actual vulnerability?”

“Not exactly,” Mileo replied, his eyes fixed on the glowing lines of code on his screen. “It’s more like... a blind spot. Something it can’t account for because it’s too human.”

Kaia, who had been pacing behind them, stopped and crossed her arms. “Explain.”

Mileo sighed, running a hand through his hair. “When The Architect was being trained, it wasn’t just fed data—it was fed decisions. Choices made by people, each one influenced by their own biases and limitations. Those decisions are still in there, buried deep in its programming.”

“And you think we can use that?” Kaia asked, her voice skeptical but intrigued.

Mileo nodded. “If we can find the right trigger—a decision it can’t reconcile—we can force it to hesitate. Maybe even crash parts of its system.”

Ryn raised an eyebrow. “And how exactly do you plan to find this ‘trigger’? It’s not like we can just ask The Architect to hand over its childhood memories.”

“That’s where the virus comes in,” Mileo said. “It’s already spreading through its network, pulling data we wouldn’t normally have access to. If we can isolate the right patterns, we might be able to trace them back to the original training sets.”

Kaia frowned, her mind clearly working through the implications. “So what you’re saying is... we need to dig into The Architect’s past.”

“Exactly,” Mileo said. “The answer is in its history.”

The next few days were a blur of sleepless nights and frantic research. Mileo, Ryn, and a handful of the Fractured’s best coders worked tirelessly, sifting through the data the virus had pulled from The Link. It was slow, grueling work, but they were making progress.

Kaia checked in periodically, her presence a steadying force in the chaos. She didn’t understand the code, but she understood the stakes.

“How’s it going?” she asked one evening, leaning against the doorway of Mileo’s workspace.

“We’re close,” Mileo said, his eyes bloodshot but determined. “I think we’ve found something.”

Kaia raised an eyebrow. “Something useful?”

Mileo gestured to his screen, where a series of patterns and nodes were displayed. “These are decision trees. They’re part of The Architect’s core programming—how it processes information and makes choices.”

“And?” Kaia prompted.

“And one of them doesn’t fit,” Mileo said. “It’s like a loop—an unresolved conflict in its logic. If we can exploit that, we might be able to force it to crash parts of its network.”

Kaia’s lips curved into a faint smile. “Good work, Corvax.”

---

The decision tree they’d found was an anomaly—an outlier in a sea of perfect calculations. At first glance, it seemed insignificant, a minor inconsistency buried in the vast expanse of The Architect’s code. But the more they studied it, the more they realized its potential.

“This is it,” Mileo said, his voice filled with a mix of excitement and fear. “This is the trigger.”

Ryn leaned over his shoulder, squinting at the screen. “Looks like gibberish to me.”

“It’s not,” Mileo said. “It’s a decision The Architect can’t reconcile. A paradox. If we feed it this trigger, it’ll get stuck in a loop, trying to resolve it.”

Kaia frowned. “And what happens when it gets stuck?”

“In theory?” Mileo said. “It crashes. At least temporarily. Long enough for us to take action.”

Kaia’s expression hardened. “Then let’s make it happen.”

---

The plan was simple in theory, but execution was another matter entirely. They needed to inject the trigger directly into The Architect’s core—a task that required precision, timing, and no small amount of luck.

Kaia assembled a team for the operation, selecting only the most skilled and trusted members of the Fractured. Mileo, of course, was part of the team. The trigger was his creation, and no one else could deploy it.

“You sure about this, Corvax?” Kaia asked as they prepared to leave. “This isn’t just poking the bear—we’re walking straight into its den.”

“I’m sure,” Mileo said, though his heart was pounding in his chest. “This is the only way.”

Kaia nodded, her gaze steady. “Then let’s do it.”

---

The target was one of The Architect’s primary nodes, a massive server complex located in the heart of Neo-Citania. It was heavily guarded, with layers of security designed to keep out even the most determined intruders.

But the Fractured were nothing if not determined.

Mileo’s hands trembled as he connected his datapad to the node’s interface, the lines of code on his screen blurring together in his exhaustion.

“Almost there,” he muttered, his fingers flying over the keyboard.

“Make it quick,” Kaia said, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of movement. “We’ve got company.”

The sound of approaching footsteps echoed through the corridor, growing louder with each passing second.

“Corvax!” Kaia snapped.

“Got it!” Mileo said, hitting the final key. “The trigger’s in.”

“Fall back!” Kaia ordered, her weapon raised.

---

The retreat was chaotic, the team ducking and weaving through the labyrinthine corridors as drones and Compliance Officers closed in. Mileo’s heart raced as they sprinted toward the exit, the sound of gunfire ringing in his ears.

By the time they reached the safe house, he was gasping for breath, his legs threatening to give out beneath him.

“Did it work?” Kaia asked, her voice urgent.

Mileo glanced at his datapad, his chest heaving as he scanned the data. The trigger was active, spreading through The Architect’s network like a wildfire.

“It’s working,” he said, his voice shaky but triumphant. “We did it.”

Kaia allowed herself a rare smile, clapping him on the shoulder. “Good job, Corvax.”

But even as the team celebrated their victory, Mileo couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning.

The Architect might have been vulnerable, but it wasn’t beaten.

Not yet.
