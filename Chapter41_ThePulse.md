# Chapter 41: The Pulse

---

Neo-Citania was changing.

It wasn’t something visible, not something anyone could point to, but it was there—an undercurrent, a vibration that seemed to hum beneath the city’s surface. For the first time in years, the people of the city weren’t just rebuilding. They were adapting.

But for the Fractured, the pulse was a warning.

---

Kaia stood in the enclave’s main chamber, her arms crossed as she watched the holographic map flicker with faint, rhythmic patterns. The city’s network was alive with activity, but it was unlike anything they had seen before.

“This isn’t normal,” she said, her voice steady but laced with concern. “The Core’s activation didn’t just wake it up. It’s... spreading.”

Mileo Corvax nodded, his eyes fixed on the map. “The pulse is everywhere. It’s in the infrastructure, the systems, the network. It’s like the city itself is resonating.”

Ryn groaned, leaning back in his chair. “Great. So now we’re fighting a city. What’s next?”

Kaia’s gaze didn’t waver. “We’re not fighting it. Not yet. But we need to figure out what it wants—and fast.”

---

The first step was to analyze the pulse.

Mileo spent hours poring over the data, tracing the patterns and rhythms that pulsed through the network. The lines of code were complex, their structure shifting and evolving as though they were alive.

“It’s not just random,” he explained during one of their late-night strategy meetings. The holographic map glowed faintly in the dim light, its lines pulsing in time with the patterns on his screen. “The pulse is... coordinated. Like a heartbeat. But it’s not just the city. It’s the people.”

Kaia frowned, leaning over the table. “What do you mean?”

Mileo hesitated, his stomach twisting into knots. “The Core isn’t just connected to the city’s infrastructure. It’s connected to us. The people of Neo-Citania. And it’s reacting to us.”

---

The realization hit the team like a physical blow.

Ryn shook his head, disbelief written across his face. “You’re saying the city is alive. That it’s... watching us?”

Mileo’s expression was grim. “Not alive. Not in the way we understand it. But it’s aware. And if we don’t figure out what it’s trying to do, we could lose control.”

Kaia’s voice was calm but firm. “Then we figure it out. Whatever it takes.”

---

The pulse led them to an unexpected place.

The signal was strongest near the city’s central hub, an area that had been rebuilt after the fall of The Architect. The streets were bustling with activity, the people moving with a sense of purpose that hadn’t been there before.

“It’s here,” Mileo said, his voice tight with concentration. “The pulse is coming from somewhere in this district.”

Kaia nodded, her gaze scanning the crowded streets. “Then we find it.”

---

The search led them to an unassuming building tucked away in the heart of the district. The structure was old, its facade weathered and cracked, but the air around it was charged with energy. The hum of the pulse was almost deafening.

Kaia led the way, her weapon raised as they entered the building. Mileo stayed close behind, his datapad clutched tightly in his hands.

“This doesn’t feel right,” Ryn muttered, his weapon at the ready. “It’s too quiet.”

Kaia’s voice was steady. “Stay sharp. We don’t know what we’re walking into.”

---

The source of the pulse was buried deep within the building.

The team navigated a labyrinth of corridors and stairwells, the hum growing louder with each step. Finally, they reached a large, open chamber filled with ancient machinery that pulsed faintly with light.

At the center of the room stood a towering structure of conduits and wires, its surface rippling with energy. Mileo’s breath caught in his throat as he approached the terminal at its base.

“This is it,” he said, his voice shaking. “The pulse.”

Kaia’s jaw tightened as she raised her weapon. “Can you shut it down?”

Mileo hesitated, his fingers trembling as he connected his datapad to the terminal. “I don’t think we should. Not yet.”

Kaia’s gaze was steady. “Why not?”

“Because it’s not a threat,” Mileo replied, his voice filled with a mix of fear and awe. “It’s... an opportunity.”

---

The process of interfacing with the pulse was unlike anything Mileo had experienced before.

The code was alive, shifting and evolving with an almost organic rhythm. It reacted to his presence, adapting to his inputs and guiding him toward something deeper.

“It’s not just a system,” Mileo said, his voice trembling. “It’s a bridge. A connection between us and the city.”

Kaia stood guard, her weapon raised as she scanned the room for any signs of movement. The air was heavy with tension, every sound amplified in the silence.

“What kind of connection?” she asked.

Mileo hesitated, his stomach twisting into knots. “I don’t know. But I think it’s trying to help us.”

---

The final moments were a blur of discovery and uncertainty.

The pulse’s patterns shifted and evolved as Mileo worked, the room vibrating with energy. The lines of code on his screen blurred together, their complexity almost overwhelming.

Finally, the terminal powered down, and the pulse faded into silence. The room was still, the air heavy with the weight of what they had just witnessed.

“It’s done,” Mileo said, his voice trembling with relief. “For now.”

Kaia placed a hand on his shoulder, her gaze steady. “What did it tell you?”

Mileo stared at the blank screen, his mind racing. “That this is just the beginning.”

---

As they emerged from the building, the city was bathed in the light of dawn. The pulse was gone, its signal silenced. But as Mileo looked out at the horizon, he couldn’t shake the feeling that their fight was far from over.

The heartbeat of Neo-Citania had been silenced.

But the pulse would return.
