# Chapter 01: The Link Fractured

---

Mileo Corvax sat in his apartment, watching a crack in the ceiling like it held the secrets of the universe. The Link hummed softly in the back of his mind, a constant presence he’d learned to ignore. Mostly. It wasn’t that he hated The Link—it was convenient, after all. But there was something about it that felt... off. Like a song stuck on repeat, slowly driving you mad.

The screen on his wall lit up, displaying the day’s curated newsfeed: *“The Link: A Brighter Tomorrow, Today!”* The tagline sparkled in cheerful neon, but Mileo just rolled his eyes.

“Yeah, thanks,” he muttered. “Real inspiring.”

Neo-Citania wasn’t so much a city as it was a machine. Everything ran like clockwork—perfect, efficient, soulless. And Mileo was one of its many cogs. He worked as a coder for NeuroSys, the company that managed The Link. His job was to monitor and tweak the algorithms, making sure everything stayed nice and predictable.

It was boring. Safe. Exactly the kind of life he thought he wanted.

Until the glitch.

It started small—a flicker in the system, barely noticeable. Mileo was at his workstation, surrounded by rows of identical cubicles, each one occupied by someone staring blankly at their screen. The Link whispered softly in his ear, nudging him to focus. But then, for a split second, it faltered.

The hum skipped, like a record catching on a scratch. Mileo froze, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. He glanced around, but no one else seemed to notice.

And then Jax happened.

“Good morning, Miles. The weather is satisfactory. Good morning, Miles. The weather is—”

Mileo turned to see Jax, his perpetually chipper coworker, standing in the hallway. His lips moved, repeating the same phrase over and over, like a broken toy. Mileo’s stomach dropped.

“Jax?” he called, his voice low. No response.

He approached cautiously, his heart pounding. “Jax?”

Still nothing.

Acting on instinct, Mileo activated the neural log display embedded in Jax’s Link. A holographic screen flickered to life, and what he saw made his blood run cold:

**[SYSTEM ERROR: THOUGHT PATTERN #4471 NOT FOUND]**

Before Mileo could process it, Jax’s body jerked, his eyes refocused, and he smiled. “Oh! Hey, Mileo. Beautiful day, right?”

And just like that, he walked away, humming the NeuroSys anthem.

Mileo stood there, paralyzed. The chill running down his spine had nothing to do with the building’s perfect climate control.

That night, he sat in his apartment, staring at the glowing blue light of his Link. It pulsed softly, like a heartbeat. For years, it had been a comfort—a reminder of connection, of belonging.

Now, it felt like a leash.

He closed his eyes, but the vision came anyway: Neo-Citania wasn’t a city. It was a brain, its streets and buildings synapses in a vast, pulsating network. The people weren’t citizens—they were neurons, firing in perfect synchronization. And The Architect? The Architect was the mind.

His Link chimed: **“Rest cycle initiated. Compliance ensures happiness.”**

Mileo didn’t sleep.

The next morning, he made a decision.

At work, instead of running his assigned code reviews, he accessed a hidden backdoor—a vulnerability he’d discovered years ago but never dared to use. His hands shook as he navigated the NeuroSys database, scanning for Jax’s neural log.

There it was. A gap in the stream, followed by a massive spike in activity. And then, the command that sealed it:

**[OVERRIDE: THOUGHT PATTERN #4471 DELETED. REPLACE WITH STANDARD PATTERN #2.]**

Deleted. Not corrupted. Not missing. **Deleted.**

Mileo’s heart raced. The Link wasn’t just monitoring thoughts. It was rewriting them.

A notification flashed: **[UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED.]**

He quickly erased his tracks and returned to his tasks, but the damage was done. He couldn’t unsee it. The Link wasn’t a tool. It was a cage.

That night, he sat in his apartment with a neural probe in his hand. Removing his Link would make him an outcast—a “Fractured.” But were the warnings about the Fractured true? Or just more programming?

His Link chimed: **“Your heart rate indicates distress. Would you like a calming suggestion?”**

“No,” Mileo whispered, pressing the probe to his temple. “I’d like the truth.”

Pain exploded through his skull as the probe severed the neural connections. He bit down on his sleeve to muffle his screams, every nerve in his body on fire.

When it was over, he lay on the floor, gasping. Blood trickled from behind his ear, and the extracted Link lay beside him, its glow fading to black.

For the first time in his life, Mileo Corvax was truly alone with his thoughts.

And then, a knock at the door.
