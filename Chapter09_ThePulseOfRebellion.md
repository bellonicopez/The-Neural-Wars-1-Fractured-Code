# Chapter 09: The Pulse of Rebellion

---

Mileo Corvax had never been this close to the heart of The Link before. Standing in the shadow of the neural hub, he felt like an ant staring up at the sun. The structure pulsed faintly, its glow an eerie mix of blue and white, casting long, ghostly shadows across the surrounding landscape.

“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Kaia whispered, crouched beside him in the cover of the trees.

“Terrifying,” Mileo corrected, his voice barely audible. “This thing controls half the city.”

“Exactly,” Kaia said, a sharp edge in her tone. “Which is why we’re about to break it.”

---

The plan was deceptively simple. Mileo would breach the hub’s outer defenses using the backdoor he’d created, allowing Kaia and the others to infiltrate the building. Once inside, they’d plant an EMP device that would fry the hub’s systems, severing its connection to The Link. 

Quick. Clean. Surgical.

At least, that was the theory.

“Ready?” Kaia asked, her eyes locked on Mileo.

He wasn’t, but he nodded anyway. “Let’s do this.”

---

The first part of the plan went off without a hitch. Mileo’s code worked like a charm, slipping past the hub’s firewalls and disabling the external security systems. The entrance doors slid open with a soft hiss, and Kaia led the team inside, her movements swift and deliberate.

Mileo stayed behind, monitoring their progress from his terminal. His fingers danced across the keyboard, his heart pounding in his chest.

“Team One, you’re clear,” he said into his comm.

“Copy that,” Kaia’s voice crackled in response. “Moving to the next checkpoint.”

---

Inside the hub, the air was cold and sterile, the walls lined with glowing panels that seemed to pulse in time with The Link. Kaia couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched, even though Mileo had assured her the cameras were offline.

“Stay sharp,” she whispered to the others. “This place isn’t as dead as it looks.”

They moved cautiously, sticking to the shadows as they made their way toward the core. The EMP device was heavy in Kaia’s pack, its weight a constant reminder of what was at stake.

“Almost there,” Mileo’s voice came through the comm. “You’ve got one more hallway to clear.”

“Got it,” Kaia replied, signaling for the team to move.

---

Back at the terminal, Mileo’s relief at their progress was short-lived. An alert flashed across his screen, and his stomach dropped.

“Kaia,” he said urgently, “you’ve got incoming. Compliance officers. Five of them, closing in fast.”

“Damn it,” Kaia muttered. “How much time do we have?”

“Not enough,” Mileo said, his fingers flying over the keyboard. “I’m trying to redirect them, but—”

A loud crash cut him off, followed by the sound of gunfire over the comm.

“Kaia!” Mileo shouted, his heart racing. “What’s happening?”

“Ambush,” Kaia’s voice came through, strained but steady. “We’re pinned down.”

Mileo’s mind raced. He wasn’t a fighter. He wasn’t even there. But he had to do something.

---

Kaia ducked behind a console, her mind working as fast as her body to assess the situation. The officers were well-trained, their movements coordinated, their firepower overwhelming.

“Corvax,” she said into the comm, “if you’ve got any bright ideas, now’s the time.”

“I’m working on it,” Mileo replied, his voice tight with concentration.

Kaia gritted her teeth, glancing at the EMP device strapped to her pack. They were so close. If they could just get to the core...

“Cover me,” she ordered, her team responding without hesitation. She sprinted toward the next console, narrowly avoiding a burst of gunfire.

“Corvax!” she shouted.

“I’ve got it!” Mileo’s voice came through, triumphant. “I’m rerouting their comms. They’ll think reinforcements are coming.”

Kaia smiled grimly. “You’re a lifesaver, Corvax.”

---

The officers hesitated, their movements faltering as Mileo’s deception took hold. Kaia seized the opportunity, leading her team in a counterattack that quickly turned the tide of the fight.

Within minutes, the officers were down, and the team was moving again.

“Core’s just ahead,” Kaia said, her voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins. “Let’s finish this.”

---

The core was a sight to behold—a massive, glowing sphere suspended in the center of the room, its surface rippling with light. It was mesmerizing, beautiful, and utterly alien.

Kaia set the EMP device at the base of the sphere, her hands moving with practiced precision.

“Corvax, we’re in position,” she said into the comm. “How much time do we have?”

“Not enough,” Mileo replied, his voice strained. “You’ve got more officers inbound. A lot more.”

Kaia’s jaw tightened. “Understood. We’ll make it quick.”

She activated the device, the timer beginning its countdown.

“Move out!” she ordered, her team falling back toward the exit.

---

The retreat was chaotic, the sound of approaching officers growing louder with each passing second. Kaia’s team moved as fast as they could, but the weight of the mission—and the enemy—was bearing down on them.

“Corvax, we’re not gonna make it,” Kaia said, her breath coming in short gasps.

“Yes, you are,” Mileo replied, his voice firm. “I’m opening an alternate exit. Just keep moving.”

The door ahead slid open, revealing a narrow passageway. Kaia didn’t hesitate, leading her team through the opening and into the tunnels beyond.

---

When they finally emerged into the night, Kaia allowed herself a moment of relief. The hub was behind them, its glow still visible in the distance.

“Corvax,” she said into the comm, “we’re clear.”

“Good,” Mileo replied, his voice heavy with exhaustion. “Because the EMP’s about to go off.”

Kaia turned, watching as the hub’s light flickered, then dimmed. A ripple of darkness spread across the skyline, the city’s lights faltering as The Link’s connection was severed.

It was a small victory, but a victory nonetheless.

Kaia turned back to her team, her expression hardening. “This is just the beginning,” she said. “The Architect knows we’re coming. And it’s not going to take this lying down.”

Mileo’s voice came through the comm, quiet but resolute. “Then we’d better be ready.”
